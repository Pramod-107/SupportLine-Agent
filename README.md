# SupportLine-Agent
This project is an Emergency Support System that helps users find the nearest police, hospital, fire, pharmacy, or cyber-crime center based on their location. Managers can add new centers through a registration interface, and the system updates instantly. Built using Solara, it provides a fast, interactive emergency response experience.
